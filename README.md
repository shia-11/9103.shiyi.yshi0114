## 🎨 Creative Coding Major Project

### 🔁 Interaction Explanation

This work responds to user interaction in two ways:  
1. The color dynamically shifts in response to mouse movement.  
2. Pressing the spacebar triggers a random color flickering effect across the entire composition.

### ✏️ Detailed Explanation of My Personal Approach

I chose to use user input as the main form of interaction, combining both mouse movement and keyboard input to drive the animation. Within our group animation project, I focused particularly on expressing color variation as a core visual element. When the user moves the mouse or presses the spacebar, the colors of the work change dynamically, creating a responsive visual experience.

My inspiration came from a small interactive piece I saw on Instagram. In the video, a small circle changes color in response to the mouse’s movement. This sparked the idea of applying a similar effect to lines, using mouse interaction to trigger color changes, which I then developed further in my own way.

### ⚙️ Technical Description

Building upon the group’s original codebase, I focused on implementing color variation without altering the core structure of the group’s code.  
Initially, I experimented with a random color variation method introduced in Week 6, but the resulting colors appeared too light and caused unwanted visual jitter.

To resolve this, I consulted AI tools and received suggestions for improvement. I eventually switched from the RGB color mode to HSB, based on a new solution provided by ChatGPT.  
This adjustment successfully addressed the issue of insufficient color saturation.
